What is XML?

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language, a markup language similar to HTML. It is
designed to store and transport data. XML became a W3C Recommendation in February 1998.

While HTML is designed to display data (focusing on how data looks), XML is designed to
carry data (focusing on what the data represents). XML does not have predefined tags like
HTML. XML stores data in plain text, which provides a software- and hardware-independent
way of storing, transporting, and sharing data. This makes it easier to move data between
systems, applications, browsers, and platforms without losing information.

XML naming rules:

- Element names are case-sensitive.
- Element names must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
- Element names cannot start with the letters "xml" in any combination of upper/lower case (for example: xml, XML, Xml).
- Element names can contain letters, digits, hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.).
- Element names cannot contain spaces.
